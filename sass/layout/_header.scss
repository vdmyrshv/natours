    //192 dpi is resolution of apple retina screen
    //second condition is to make sure that the query is selecting for not phone screens
    //phone screens are usually retina screens but still dont need to be very large files
    //combine multiple conditions with media queries with an 'and'

    //COMMA BETWEEN MEDIA QUERIES IS THE SAME AS AN OR STATEMENT instead of writing two diff media queries
    //rememeber media queries are in em


    //it is best practice to add "only screen and..." to media queries
